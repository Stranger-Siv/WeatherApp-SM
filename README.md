# Weather Web Application

## Overview

The Weather Web Application is a simple and elegant tool that provides real-time weather information for any city worldwide. Built with React, the app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with corresponding icons.

This project is a showcase of React fundamentals, including state management, event handling, and API integration.
